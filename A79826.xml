         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is above twenty years ſince we were Contemporaries at <hi>Oxford,</hi> under our Reverend, Pious, Sound, and Learned Tutor, Dr. <hi>Edw.

The mercy of our Tuition, is not to be forgotten of us, nor can I forget your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, which hath not been <hi>Aeffaeta gignendo,</hi> barren by Production, like pregnant Animals, and vegetative Trees.

            <p>We live in an unhappy Age, wherein by many the <hi>Form,</hi> by moſt <hi>the Power of Godlyneſs</hi> is neglected. Though tis a Mercy, Religion is in ſome Forme and Faſhion, yet 'tis a miſery, the Faſhion is ſo <hi>Multiform,</hi> &amp; in every different dreſs ſo <hi>Obnoxious,</hi> &amp; that <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> are too common <hi>Antipodes.</hi> Wronging <hi>Gods Grace</hi> is <hi>Englands</hi> Epidemical ſin. None of the quarrelling ſides among us can plead Innocence. Though the ſpots of Gods children, and the Devils are not the ſame; yet to our ſhame be it ſpoken, all ſides have too much darkened the glory of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, obſcured the luſtre of the Goſpel Sun, and laid the Honour of Gods name in the duſt. Seeing our ſtreets are ſo foul, I would mind every one to ſweep their own doors, that the times of Liberty may no longer be reproached, as they are, with a dirty, wanton, unjuſt Licentiouſneſſe, in Opinions, and Practiſes. The ſad experience that the old man is in my ſelf too much a Libertine, and what I have ſeen and heard of others, put me upon large Meditations, ſundry years ago in my Lordſday Sermons to mine own Auditory, concerning <hi>the Peſt of the Times, Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

Though it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ſhould be ſo loud, vocal, and monitory, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb facs="tcp:119125:3"/> by ſome pious and judicious friends, I am imboldned to take the benefit of the Preſſe, and to communicate thoughts in ſeaſon, to as many hands, eyes, and hearts, as Providence ſhall guide them to. I beſeech you (Sir) the happineſſe of whoſe Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity and Amity, I have experienced, peruſe and improve what you ſhall read, to an holy conviction, ſerious bewailing, and deep abhorrence of an odious ſin which hath too black a guilt, and is loaded with many aggravating circumſtances. This will be a choice divine Bleſſing on the Tractate, the Authors Reward, and a Teſtimony of the Grace of God in you. The Goſpel, the precious Goſpel, that hath coſt the Blood of Chriſt, and Chriſtians, the ſweet word of Grace, the power of God unto Salvation, let it be precious in your holy eſteem: And though Papiſts <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Qui de evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio Chriſt facium homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis evangeliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vel quod pejus eſt diaboli.</hi> Hier.

The things I would offer to mine own ſoul, I tender to you. Be inquiſitive what may deſervedly bear the brand of <hi>Goſpel Wantonneſſe,</hi> when it appears, and interpret it as the Meſſenger of Hell, the Artifice of the Devil turned Angel of Light, the not more ſubtile than pernicious Engine to ruin ſouls. Be one of <hi>Zions</hi> Mourners in your Cloſet Retirements, to look over this worſt of ſins, the predominant wrong of Grace, with a mourning ſpirit. Endeavour to live a ſevere, exact, ſpiritual, heavenly frame of heart, that when you are to give up your Death-bed account, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, Peace, Puritie and Comfort, may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p>And, Noble Madam, as the Tye of Marriage, and the Union (I hope) of Grace, hath made you and my dear Coſen one, ſo have I made you one in my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolary addreſs. If the divine principle of the love of God and his Goſpel be implanted in you, it cannot but urge you to the deteſtation of, and lamentation for the prodigious ſin of Goſpel Wantonneſs: whilſt ſome Femal vvantons ſtudy their ſenſes and faces, not their ſouls, who beautifie their out-ſides, whilſt their inſides are altogether diſ-regarded; be pleaſed among other ſpiritual Looking-glaſſes, which religious Artiſts, and faithfull Writers have with elaborate thoughts compoſed, to honour this, ſo far as often to look on it, to dreſs your better part by it, that when it ſhall reflect and reverberate your gracious beauty, you may praiſe the infinite Beauty and Fountain of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you may be Great and Good too; and this is a moſt rare, and happy combination. A few there are in the words of an Ancient, that are eminent in both <note place="margin">

I like not, but altogether abhorre that moroſe Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme and Quakeriſme that frowns on the Titles of worldly precedencies, as unbecoming Chriſtians eares &amp; tongues. Due Titles are no crimes of Language, nor unconſiſtent with Piety; yet I hope you have learned the vaſt diſtance between the ſtile of Madam, and
<pb facs="tcp:119125:4"/> Chriſtian, and that in the divine Heraldry, the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſcent of Grace will out-ſhine all the <hi>Eſcutchions,</hi> and the glorious aiery appellations of worldly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies.

            <p>I Shall not detain thee with a long Preface, leſt I may be injurious by keeping thee too long in the threſhold: Onely a few things I ſhall premiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the reverend Author,</hi> and his excellent work.

Of later years my acquaintance hath been much increaſed with this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Author, and I rejoyce therein: He hath for theſe fifteen years in <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> (Where he now reſides) given abundant teſtimony of his induſtry and fidelity, in the diſcharge of his Miniſtery, and hath ſtudied to approve himſelf <hi>a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed.</hi> He hath, (as it is ſaid of <hi>Demetrius) obtain'd a good report, and of the truth:</hi> He is ſound in the faith, and holy in life, &amp; both by his life and Doctrine, makes it his buſineſs <hi>to win many ſouls unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> I adde no more concerning the Author, neither need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I have ſaid ſo much, for he needs not my Letters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: His Works ſpeak far lowder, <hi>and praiſe him in the Gate.</hi> That * Corporation (where thoſe † two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants of Chriſt do now exerciſe their Ministery) hath great cauſe of thankfulneſs, becauſe God hath raiſed up ſuch able Miniſters now upon the place, in the room of their * worthy Predeceſſors, (with moſt of them I rejoyce that I have had the honor of acquaintance.) And that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who like <hi>Capernaum,</hi> have been lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>† <hi>Mr.</hi> Claget. <hi>M.</hi> Sclater. <hi>M.</hi> Gibbons. <hi>M.</hi> White. <hi>M.</hi> Calamy. burroughs. <hi>M.</hi> Sainthill. <hi>M.</hi> Wall.
<pb facs="tcp:119125:6"/> ven with Goſpel means, ought to remember, <hi>That where much is given, much is required.</hi> As for ſuch who forſake faithful Teachers, and the Publick Aſſemblies, I heartily wiſh them timely and ſerious repentance, and that their Palates might have a right taſte, then they will conclude, <hi>that the old wine is better then their new;</hi> and that godly ordained Miniſters, are better then upſtart, un-called, ſelf-conceited Seducers.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Book (the whole deſign whereof is to advance grace, and decry the abuſe thereof) it cannot be expected, that I ſhould ingage to bring of every Phraſe, Punctillo, or Tittle, according to the curioſity of Criticks. As for ſuch, whoſe fancies out-run their judgements, and with whom affectations of new coyn'd words, are more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued then <hi>the form of ſound words;</hi> I am not careful to anſwer them in theſe matters, neither do I think their exceptions worthy of an Anſwer. However, I am fully perſwaded, that the Treatiſe is ſolid and profitable, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to edification; and throughout the whole, there runs a line of a gracious ſpirit: And whoever profits not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, hath more reaſon to queſtion himſelf, then the Author: For if pride and prejudice be laid aſide, I doubt not, but (through <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing) much ſpiritual advantage will follow, upon the ſerious and deliberate peruſal of this <hi>Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if any one Object that the World is glutted with multitude of <hi>Books;</hi> my anſwer is, For good, Orthodox, ſolid Writers, we have reaſon to bleſs <hi>God,</hi> for ſuch helps we have by them, and ought to be deſirous for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al increaſe of them: As for vain, frothy, unſound Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we wiſh that they were ſuppreſt altogether: For ſome <hi>Books,</hi> we have too many; and of others, which are rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, heretical, and blaſphemous, we wiſh we had not any at all, but that they and their Authors might be buryed
<pb facs="tcp:119125:6"/> together, and never be reviv'd, as now adays (with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be it mentioned) they are, and become voluminous, to the great injury of the Church of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for ſuch excellent Books as we have had of late years, I have cauſe to bleſs <hi>God</hi> that ever I read <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field of conſcience. <hi>M. Wall</hi>'s none but Chriſt. <hi>M. Ford</hi> of Adoption. <hi>Mr. Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's</hi> Ark. <hi>M. Reyners</hi> Precepts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> them: I heartily wiſh that there were more of that kinde: One of the ſame ſtamp is this Treatiſe. The man and his Communication is one and the ſame: His deſign, (I am perſwaded) is in the ſingleneſs of his heart to bring glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>God,</hi> in advancing of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. He was hardly prevail'd withal to put this Work to Print; but having communicated it to me, and referr'd it to my determination, after a deliberate peruſal thereof, I would not by any means ſuppreſs that which I conceived might conduce to the publick good.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (Reader) be pleaſed to ſpend ſome time (and it will be no loſt time) in a careful reading of this profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Treatiſe; and if thou be not wanting to thy ſelf, I conceive thou wilt reap much benefit for thy precious ſoul. And this further requeſt I have to thee, that thou would'ſt be mindful of the Author at the Throne of <hi>Grace;</hi> and of him alſo, who rejoyceth, that he hath been in any way inſtrumental to bring to light this Treatiſe, which in love to thy ſoul he hath now made publick, and remains,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. When are the means of grace abuſed? They are ſo, 1. when they are ſet higher than they are. Means are made Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, ſet in the room of Chriſt, when an equall, yea a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour confidence is put in Inſtrumental inſtitutions. The hand and the courage of the Warriour is diſparaged, when the Sword is ſet up above him, and there be more confidence in a dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument than in a living agent. The Word, the Sword of the Spirit, is dead and ſucceſſeleſſe out of the ſtrong and living hand of the Spirit. It is a double and common wrong, both to the means of grace, and to Chriſt, when Chriſt is not eyed, ſought to, admired, truſted in by the means: The error not onely of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, prophane Chriſtians, that truſt in a bare Baptiſm, and a following of their Church to ſave them; but moſt real Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſome whereof more admire their Preachers than Jeſus Chriſt; more look after an impotent man with all the glory of his gifts, than the power, and the tranſcendently eminent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Lord Jeſus. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught a better leſſon, who although he planted and watered Churches, with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous ſucceſſe, owned his <hi>own nothingneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 11. ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the thoughts of <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. was jealous of robbing Chriſt of his glory, gave him the honour <hi>of his grace and power,</hi> that he was uſed as the exalted and bleſſed inſtrument to convert multitudes of ſinners, and ſave their ſoules. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18, 19. <note place="margin">2 When mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of grace are ſet lower then they are</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they are ſet lower than they are. Then they are ſo when they are accounted as uſeleſſe needleſſe things, as if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119125:29"/> heaven could be got without them, grace might be had and kept, though the means diſuſed. Nothing is more clear than that in ordinary diſpenſation (extraordinaries not being our rule) God hath confined grace and ſalvation to the uſe of means. <hi>Knowledge,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. <hi>The Goſpel preached,</hi> Rom. 1. 13. <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. <hi>Prayer,</hi> Ro. 10. 13. <hi>The education of godly family guides,</hi> Gen. 18. 19. <hi>Excommunications,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>The holy counſels and examples of Husbands and Wives one to another,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 16. The means of grace to the reproach of the God of grace, are exceedingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, when the ſottiſh and conceited generation, that live without Ordinances, hold there is no dependance at all on holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eternal happineſſe upon Gods inſtituted means. They are alſo ſet lower than they are, when encumbred, with <hi>Martha,</hi> about needleſſe things, in the brood of earthly cares and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neglect their attendances on heavenly means, and make their affaires below excuſes (as too many doe, to the diſhonour of their regenerate part, juſt as ſtudious worldlings) to put by heavenly exerciſes in the Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When they are contradicted, and blaſphemed, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s <note place="margin">3 Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> means of Grace are contradicted and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> preaching was by the Jews, true Prayer by the Spirit, by unſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, graceleſſe Atheiſts, that revile godly care of holy houſhold guides, to keep their children and ſervants in the knowledge, fear, and love of God, whoſe pious endeavours to ſave the ſoules of their families, condemning their wicked neighbours irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is the occaſion, but not the cauſe, of their blaſpheming their Prayers, ſinging of Pſalmes, ſtrict keeping of the Sabboth, and week dayes, holy and righteous converſation; when the holy and heavenly inſtitutions of the Lord Jeſus are the markes at which ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Belial</hi> ſhoot the arrows of their bitter words, the meanes of grace are eminently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</p>

It is an irrational concluſion, A patient hath good phyſick, therefore he ſhall recover; a dunce hath good books, and a good tutor, therefore he will be a ſcholar; a great Army is well furniſhed for war, therefore it ſhall overcome: <hi>The battel is not to the</hi>

                     <hi>ſtrong,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 11. As unſcripturall an inference it is, The means of grace are enjoyed, therefore the grace of the means is obtained. <hi>Capernaum was lifted up to heaven in means, and yet caſt to hell.</hi> Mat. 11. 23. Ordinances doe not confer grace, as fire doth heat, by their natural vertue; but as the Lord Chriſt healed the ſick by ſupernaturall. Grace is not in the means as cauſes, but by them as inſtruments. Should many men have no uſe of the means to plead for their ſpirituall eſtate, there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſpeak them really Chriſtian, but they would be left as naked heathens.

The Sacrifices and Temple were not to be <hi>a Sanctuary of Murder, Adultery, Falſe ſwearing, Idolatry.</hi> Jer. 7. 9, 10. Nor were the Phariſees <hi>to make long prayers, to cloak the devouring of widdows houſes,</hi> Luk. 20. 47. The Harlots <hi>beginning with Gods ſervices</hi> were poor fig leaves <hi>to cover her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.</hi> Prov. 7. 14. Prayers in the morning, and evening, cold and barren, cannot palliate the licentious wickedneſſe that is between them. They may now quiet and ſtop the mouth of Conſcience, they cannot in the other world. It is the high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the meanes of grace, when they are but names, not powers; when in attendances on them, there is but the colour, not the heat of Chriſtianity. A painted, gilded Chriſtian abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Ordinances, when he is dead under them hath no life, nor heat by them; he borrows from them a Sheeps-skin, when he is but a goat; when it is ſeen that heavenly meanes mend not helliſh hearts and lives, the ſeeming is Saint-like, but the converſation Devilliſh. This undoes two ſoules at once; <hi>The ſin ſhrowding pretender to Religion, and the prophane blaſphemer of the means of Grace.</hi> Both of them periſh as mock-gods; the one becauſe hee hath hypocritically uſed the meanes; the other, becauſe he hath blaſphemouſly railed at the means.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When they are uſed in vain; when there is no health by <note place="margin">6 When the meanes are uſed in vain.</note> Gods phyſick, no converſion and reformation by Gods Word. In the courſe of the Miniſtry there is cunning and labouring in vain. The heavenly frequent fiegers of the Ordinances are raiſed from the Devils garriſons <hi>re infecta,</hi> Sathans ſtrong holds are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoliſhed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> The reall kingdome of Sathan is in the

Under Goſpel-ordinances men are worſe and worſe; this is a prophane diſparagement to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt; an unpleaſing ſpectacle to the holy God and his Angels, the Spirits grief, aggravation of ſin, and treaſuring up of wrath.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When they are totally neglected. Not onely one, but all <note place="margin">7 When the meanes are totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</note> the means of life and ſalvation are careleſly ſlighted, unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vilified, as if God, Chriſt, the Spirit, Grace, Heaven, Hell, were not worth the thinking of, ſuch contempt is caſt on the golden ciſterns of Grace. There are too many who proclaime their oppoſition to the God of Heaven, and the method of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who are ſo far from the power, that they abhorre the very form of godlyneſſe, ſo little care for ſervice to Chriſt, that they deteſt the badges of his government. Theſe conſtantly prophane the Sabboth, are never found on their knees ſeeking God; hear no Sermons from year to year; care not for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; have no good family education; are hardened by their afflictions; deride holy examples; theſe are in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans full poſſeſſion, take the liberty of the times to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and as to the Ordinances of Chriſt, quiet and reſolved Libertines. Be you intreated, that have ſeen the power, and beauty, and glory of God in his Sanctuary, and that have had the waters of life running into your thirſty ſoules through the precious pipes of divine Ordinances, that really value them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, ſtir up thoſe compaſſionate bowels, that the divine nature hath begotten in you, and if your counſels to Chriſtianize theſe Heathens will not prevaile, pray and weep them into poſſibilities of ſalvation, by attendance on the means of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: The Evil of abuſing the means of Grace, laid to heart, might be ſome remedy to ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a wrong to God that appointed them. Man cannot bear the violation of his houſhold orders, and will God bear it? if ſo the Laws of his family ſhould be contemned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They wrong the Spirit that acts in them, either by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their backs upon him, when he uſually affords his preſence in Gods wayes, or by reſiſting his gracious impulſes, his ſweet whiſpers, his terrible repreſentations of an accurſed loſt ſinner out of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. Either they will not hear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakings,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119125:31"/> or diſregard them, both deſpiſe the Spirit of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They pleaſe the Devil, who hath either way graceleſſe ſoules in his poſſeſſion, either <hi>by not uſing the means at all, or in vain.</hi> Such abuſers of ſaving means, are an unpleaſing ſpectacle to the holy Angels, enemies to God, grieve the Spirit, and are the Devils triumph. Conſider,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: What are thoſe means of grace that are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wantonneſſe? They are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The holy Scriptures. <hi>In them alone eternal life is to be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 The holy Scriptures are turned into Wantonneſs.</note> 
                     <hi>found,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. They are ſtiled, <hi>the word of Grace.</hi> Act. 20. 32. Their abuſe is in their diſuſe, when either they that may have Bibles, have none, or if they have them, they ſuffer them to contract duſt on their ſhelves, laying them by as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, are ſeldome, or never read; or in their ill uſe when they are read, without reverence, diligence, obſervance, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, or good deſires and affections to follow the teachings of the Spirit without underſtanding, eſteem, remembrance, laying up, and laying out theſe heavenly treaſures in righteouſneſſe and holyneſſe. Again, in their ill uſe, when they are wreſted to errours, hereſies, looſeneſs, covetouſneſs, unrighteouſneſs. When Scripture is urged againſt Scripture, and the inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt are urged againſt themſelves. Such ſcripture depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are their own deſtroyers. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. <note place="margin">2 The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel is, when the Call, Perſon, and Meſſages of Miniſters are abuſed.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Miniſtry of the Goſpel is an abuſed means, when both their perſon, calls and meſſages are uniuſtly deſpiſed, are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as offſcouring, are diſenabled from doing good to ſcoffing and malicious perſons, who either will not hear them, or with ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prejudices, amounting to no leſſe wickedneſs, in interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than deſpiſing the Lord Jeſus, and calling upon inſolent contemners irremedileſs wrath. <note place="margin">3 Sermons are means abuſed <hi>Vacuitatem ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris Dei &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sermons are abuſed means; and they never are ſo, but when they are the ſad fruits and products <hi>of hearts void of Gods fear, and without repentance. No wonder if the divine word be loathed, and holy Sermons be contemned,</hi> when fearleſs, ſhameleſs, and faithleſs hearts have ſlight thoughts of them, and care little for them, as if they were but ſcare-crows for children, very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when ſound, heavenly meſſages are either not heard at all, or not attentively, not reverently, not underſtandingly, not wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not fervently, not frequently, not perſeveringly, not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119125:31"/> not reſigningly, giving up the judgement to be captivated to the obedience of faith, the heart and life to the power of godlyneſs, but are heard with a contrary corrupt frame of heart, then is a means of grace abuſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sacraments are abuſed means, when the ſupernatural grace <note place="margin">4 Sacraments are meanes abuſed.</note> they ſignifie is not ſought for, regarded, nor obtained. Their holy, eternall obligations to ſound faith and heavenly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who conſiders? As the Jews prophaned their Sacraments, looſe Chriſtians doe theirs. Thoſe reſted on the Circumciſion of the fleſh, and the outward Paſſeover; <hi>Jews without, and not within,</hi> wicked in hearts and lives. Theſe reſt on Baptiſmal Water, Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, <hi>Christians without, and not within,</hi> unconverted, unſanctified in hearts and lives. Theſe doe prophane offered Sacramental grace, utterly voyd of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental graces and lives. Theſe by their own confeſſions, are dedicated and devoted to Jeſus Chriſt, to forſake the fleſh, the devill, the pomp and vanities of this wicked world, and they doe nothing leſs. Theſe by taking the Bread and Wine, the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentations of the ſhed blood, and broken body of Jeſus Chriſt, are ſuppoſed, and obliged to have grace, and grow in it; but they neither have the beeing, nor growth of grace; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely take <hi>the bread of the Lord,</hi> with unbeleeving, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hearts, <hi>but not the bread the Lord,</hi> with faith, repentance, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Panem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, non panem Dominum.</hi> Auguſt.</note> and other graces. It will not be the leaſt aggravation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians wantonnizing with the grace of God. The wicked abuſe of the Sacraments, will prove them undeniable Libertines. What affinity is there between the cleanſing water of Baptiſme, and Baptized perſons, wallowing in the filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, lying and delighting, like ſwine, in the mire, in the pollutions of the world? What agreement is there between a pretended feeding on the pure immortal food, Jeſus Chriſt, and feeding on Satans proviſions, the delicious luſts, and ſweet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin? Is not this to turn the Table of the Lord into the Table of Devils, an holy into a prophane feaſt; as if the holy Supper were inſtituted to pamper and quicken, not ſtarve and mortifie corruption? How epidemicall and ſpreading is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe? They are the words of an holy, affectionate Writer: <note place="margin">

I ſhall enlarge this point, with an hearty advice, to them that have a minde and time to read Books, let them take heed what they read; Satan (I fear) hath the liberty of the Preſs, as well as Jeſus Chriſt: There are Books of Libertiniſm abroad: It had been well for ſome, had they never been publiſhed in the world, whoſe mindes are dangerouſly infected, without infinite mercy, to their deſtruction: In the other World, what if undone ſouls, by wicked Books, ſhould wiſh the eyes of their fleſh had been blinde, and ears deaf, that they could have neither read nor heard of Printed Error and Looſneſs, to their deſtruction: The Devil hath his market and merchants, fooliſh Chapmen are deceived, and take the bad ware of darkneſs for light, fleſh for ſpirit: O ye ſimple gulled People of this Nation, cheated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of your Chriſtianity and Civility, unleſs ye will be fooliſh and proud, take the advice of your learned godly Miniſters, of ſettled, ſollid, experienced Chriſtians, and ask them what Books you ſhould read.

The gracious, low ſpirited Chriſtians, whoſe light is in a dark lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, that ſhine forth to outward view little or nothing of the glory and power of Religion: O ye Chriſtians of the lower form, look to thoſe that have out-learned you in Chriſts School, continue not ſtill in your weak Graces and ſtrong Corruptions! ſee you not ſome of your fellow-Converts are very Heavenly? Let this correct your earthineſs: Are ſome meek? let this ſhame and cure your paſſions; Have they liberal hearts and hands? let this open your ſhut bowels and purſes; Can they forgive great wrongs? let this blame and mend you that can hardly paſs by little; Dare they not ſpeak idely and frothily, guarding the doors of their lips?

As in the <note place="margin">8 Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling grace is turned into Wantonneſs.</note> former Section the choice Preſidents of Grace, ſo in this, and the following particulars, the choice priviledges of Grace will appear to be abuſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Rom. 5. 10. The propitiatory atoning ſacrifice of Chriſts death, in putting away Gods deſtructive wrath is rich grace. Even this is injured. Reconciliation with God ſtands, in many, with agreement with Satan, what in them lies peace with God and ſin kiſſe each other, as if a league with heaven and hell could ſtand together. Seditious perſons reconciled to their Prince, abuſe his goodneſs, when at the ſame time they are Traiterous friends with his enemies, hold intelligence with them, doe homage to them, are ruled by them, and propagate their dominions, are the picture of thoſe wanton Traitors that abuſe Gods Reconciling grace. That grace of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is reconciled to the ſinner, and the ſinner to him, begets an univerſall peace with all his laws and methods of holyneſse,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119125:36"/> and war with ſinne. At what time friendſhip is commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſoul, war is waged and maintained againſt ſin. Reconciliation and Alteration go together: Turning away his wrath from the ſinner, and turning of the heart of the ſinner are undevided. What pleaſeth a pacified God, pleaſeth the ſons of peace: When the face of God ſhines in ſmiles of peace, the Laws of God are favours, no offences; priviledges, no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; ſweet delights, no unpleaſing tasks; the liberty, not priſon of really pacified beleevers: <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165. The <hi>Romans</hi> that had peace with God, ſtood in this Goſpel-grace, engaged to be holy, not allowed to be Libertines. The exerciſes of graces, not allowances to luſts, were the fruit of this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconcilement. <hi>Rom. 5. 10, 11, &amp;c.</hi> It is a choice <hi>bleſſing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſts death.</hi> Rom. 5. They are bleſſed who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by him, and not offended in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 6. But they that refuſe the Laws of his government, had never yet the joy of atonement, though they pleaſingly vote themſelves the friends of God, they will be made to their own ſmart to know, it is one thing to bee reconciled when enemies, it is another thing to be reconciled and abide enemies: No enemies to the Laws of Chriſt, and Goſpel-holineſs were ever actually recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; they are yet under wrath that are under the reign of ſin. Let them conſider it that take up, keep and uſe armes of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie againſt the God of peace. Thoughts of reconcilement may be pleaſing, they will be a vaniſhing dream: Divine Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in order to Communion. Libertines cannot walk with God, and ſee his ſmiles, that turn back upon God, and hate his Laws.</p>

Their profeſſed owning of God their Father in an externall covenant of Grace, with unchild-like rebellions, did aggravate their abominations. Their want on luſts ſpoyled their Adoption: God was in Title, <hi>the Devil in reallity their father.</hi> Joh. 8. 44. His Luſts, but not the divine Laws of Jeſus Chriſt ruled over them. Too much a kin are diſſolute Chriſtians to the Jews, diſhonourers of adopting grace. The looſer, the ſtricter ſort of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Looſer. With what boldneſſe, confidence, yea impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doe many ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> who have nothing leſſe than the diſpoſitions and affections of children? as if God could own Satans image for his living pictures, and perpetuall eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſaffections, enmities, yea reproaches could have any reconcilement with the heavenly dignity of Adoption. God that hath taught men to pray, hath bid no man to lye, and to ſay hee is their Father in Chriſt, when they are unchriſtian in heart and life. I confeſſe the worſt of men may wiſh they had reall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Adopting grace. But under the Fatherhood of Satan, to claim ſpiritual Sonſhip, is ſo to call God Father, as <hi>Judas</hi> called Chriſt Maſter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 45. a mockery, but not a truth.

Am I not an impure offspring of Hell, though I pretend to an heavenly progeny? Will theſe thoughts, words, and actions ſpeak Gods children? Theſe ſerious reflexions are very rare.

                  <p n="1">1. Chriſtians of ſtrict profeſſion, that are indeed children. What doe you for your fathers name? Doe not even you, that ſhall hear theſe ſweet words from the mouth of your Judge and Saviour, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> hinder his renown in the world? Are not you Key-cold, Hard-hearted, of diſ-ingenuous unchild-like ſpirits, when you ſee the dreadfull teſtimonies of his diſhonour? Doe not you, who in the next world ſhall lift up his name, and make his praiſe glorious, caſt down his name, and make it infamous? Your undutifulneſs to your dear Father is too much, that your too looſe hearts diſhonour him, and inward wickedneſſe provokes his abſence; but is it not enough in irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and diſobedience within doors to wrong your childhood? will you dare to diſhonour him, and your ſelves in the publick ſtreet of common notices? Againſt the precious fame of your Father, how are your tongues heated with a fiery ſatan, and the flames of ungoverned paſſion, to abound in tranſgreſſion before malicious obſervers, glad of your halting? How unwarily doe you publiſh your over-eager, yea it may be in ſome things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious chaſes after the worlds gainfull prizes? Why diſcover you the nakedneſs of your diſ-love and hardneſs to forgive a ſaint or ſinner? Why doth your voluptuouſneſs, too much declare you yet live not above the world? Why are you ſilly chapmen to take off the braid wares of corrupt errours? Have no opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions taught you looſeneſs? Why doe you not ſhew you are Chriſtians to purpoſe, in doing illuſtrious ſingular things; that the neighbours that ſtudy your lives, and are ſtrangers to your inward Faith and Love may ſay, Theſe are children of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, would I were in their condition? It is not the language

How have you defaced your Adoption, when your ſinfull omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of convincing duties, and breakings forth of corruption, ſharpen the edge of bitter language, and tempt to theſe words of reproach; O theſe are the children of God (in ſcorn) deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you the honour, becauſe you have denyed God the glory, and your ſelves the credit of your Adoption. Let this lord your hearts for your unwatchful and diſhonourable converſation, and call for future caution: Your publick ſinnes make your Father hear ill in the world.</p>

Did you never read, there are <hi>hypocritical mockers in feaſts?</hi> Pſal. 35. 16. The ſevere cenſurers of Hypocriſie had need be upright. Are not you eminently groſly guilty of the crime you cry down? If you will not believe it, it is eaſie to prove it, deny it if you can: Do not you profeſs ſalvation only by Jeſus Chriſt? Do not you know, <hi>except you be born again, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven?</hi> Joh. 3. 5.

Sin and pardon, pardon and ſin, is their circle of deluſion: But ſin and repentance are ſtrangers to each other: What a diſhonor is this to pardoning Grace? It is made by theſe men, the Incourager and Patron of ſin, as the Popes indulgences, and large Pardons for ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, out of his rich, cheating par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don office, are to blinde Papiſts: How do Libertines turn the pardon office of Heaven, and throne of Grace erected by the Lord Jeſus, into a Stews of uncleanneſs, a free opening of Hell Gates, an open Market for any to buy the Devils Wares?

You are wholly ſelfiſh in your thoughts, hopes, and deſires of pardon, would have God blot out your ſinnes to ſerve your own turn, not to ſerve him; to ſinne with a peaceable ſpirit, not ſerve him with a pure conſcience; That you might not goe to Hell, not that you might be fit for Heaven. O Chriſtians! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe not upon theſe accounts pardoning grace: If you doe, and die in this wickedneſs, be ſure theſe conſiderations, will like fire flaſhing about the ears, in the other world, flame upon your conſciences, as daring wantons, that have played and ſported with Gods pardons. If you ſay, God forbid we ſhould abuſe pardoning grace, we are free from ſo great a ſinne; Take heed you dream not of innocence, where the Word chargeth you with guilt: Surely you play the wantons with pardoning grace, if ſeven things are verified of you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you ſinne in hope of pardon, which is wretched pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <note place="margin">1.

What is this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of pardon, but a confirmation in ſin, and an encourgae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe ſtill more wickedly?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If after your aſſurance, that you are pardoned, you bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">2 To ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hopes of pardon is to welcome the fleſh.</note> willingly, and delightingly bid the next temptations wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, this is in effect as if you ſhould ſay, Welcome fleſh, we are your ſervants; welcome devil, we are your ſubjects; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come world, with all your ſnares, ſinfull pleaſures and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we will refuſe none of you, we are out of gun-ſhot, you can doe us no hurt; we had lately a pardon ſent into our boſoms, and now we may have liberty of ſport and dalliance; we have a gracious God that will forgive us, and a ſuretie who will pay
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119125:44"/> all our debts: If this be your caſe, do you not clearly affront pardoning grace?</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. When you goe on in ſin, after thoughts of pardon, you <note place="margin">4 To ſin after thoughts of pardon, ſhews no love unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</note> have no ſincere love to Jeſus Chriſt. Many reſt in hopes, yea ſome in aſſurances, they are forgiven, who yet never heartily loved the Lord Chriſt. They never had a <hi>love to labour for his name.</hi> Revel. 2. 3. <hi>to prize his preſence,</hi> Pſal. 16. 8. to ſtoop to his ſtrict ſpiritual Government, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. to regard <hi>his image,</hi> to be living Saints, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. To have evill,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. An eminent, yet pardoned ſinner, will prove this high abuſe of pardoning grace: <hi>Much was forgiven her, for ſhe loved much,</hi> Luk. 7. 47. She could not but anſwer love for love. If you that write your ſelves down in your quiet conſciences, abſolved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, love not the Lord Jeſus, you are worſe than Publicans, <hi>they love thoſe that love them.</hi> Mat. 5. 46. If a liberal creditor ſhould freely forgive all your debts, could you deny your love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe carriage to him is an high abuſe of his goodneſſe? Should you hate your ſuretie, conſcience would tell you his love ſhould be abuſed. Thus doe you deal with God your creditor, Chriſt your ſuretie, you diſgrace the pardoning grace you thinke you have from them, when you hate the Father and the Sonne, yea abhorre the guiding your hearts and lives by the Spirits motions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If after thoughts of obtained pardon, you have no tender <note place="margin">5 Then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning grace is abuſed, when there is no tender conſcience, &amp;c.</note> conſcience, no mournings, weepings, meltings of love, of Goſpel joy for Abſolution, no ſerious ſenſe of the diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evill, even of pardoned ſinne, no watchfull, fearefull thoughts of the next tranſgreſſion, no ſorrowfull apprehenſion of renewed ſin. When you came over a narrow bridge, and very hardly ſaved your life, are not you tender of comming that way again? You have narrowlie ſcaped hell, doe you think pardoning grace hath kept you off it? O where is your tenderneſſe of ſinning there again, where you had been almoſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119125:45"/> plunged into the bottomleſſe pit. An heart hardned in ſin, after thoughts of granted forgiveneſſe, is an evident wrong to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If after thoughts of getting a pardon you have no holy <note place="margin">6 Pardoning grace is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when there is no ſhame for ſin</note> ſhame for your ſinnes: <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was pardoned, but in an holy ſhame <hi>ſhee ſtood behind her Saviour,</hi> Luk. 7. 38. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved <hi>Romans were aſhamed,</hi> even of their pardoned ſinnes, <hi>Rom. 6. 21. Ye are now,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>aſhamed of them.</hi> Ingenious children of God are aſhamed, when renewing repentance in their Fathers preſence, they looke over the black roll even of pardoned ſinnes. Surely you that have impudent reflections on your conceited ſinnes, yea have no ſhame to keep you off from renewed and pleaſing ſins, do much diſparage pardoning grace.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If after thoughts your ſins are pardoned, you cannot, you <note place="margin">7 Pardoning grace is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when you will not pardon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> will not pardon others, not your enemies, not your friends, not your joynt profeſſors of the ſame heavenly faith and hope, not your loving reprovers, not your hearty interceſſors at the throne of grace for you. Are you indeed pardoned that cannot pardon? Pardon of ſin is an eminent part of Goſpel-glory. True believers <hi>are changed into it,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. When they ſee how much they are forgiven, they cannot but forgive; when they ſee an hundred debts are forgiven, will they ſtrain at it to forgive one? Yea when God forgives a thouſand to one, ſhall they not blot out a few? I dare boldly ſay, Thoſe that take it for granted their ſins are pardoned, that are implacable, that write wrongs in marble, not in the duſt, be their confidences never ſo high, do both un-Chriſtian, and un-Man themſelves.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. No thankful return will be to Jeſus Chriſt: The gift and benefit of everlaſting righteouſneſs, deſerves everlaſting thanks: It was never yet known, that an unſanctified perſon was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119125:47"/> to Jeſus Chriſt: He challengeth <hi>cordial, verbal, vital</hi> thanks, but all this is above the reach of unregeneracy: A carnal perſon can complement Chriſt with the cheap praiſe of the lips, but his ſoul, and <hi>all that is within him,</hi> Pſal. 103. 1. His converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can <hi>never bleſs him:</hi> He wants the Goſpel-power of an holy and a righteous life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No reputation will be to Faith: Indeed it hath the honor to be the Grace that lays hold on Chriſts perfect Righteouſneſs; but this is not its onely office, It <hi>ſanctifies</hi> as well as <hi>juſtifies,</hi> Acts 26. 18. Rom. 5. 1. It <hi>purifies</hi> as well as pacifieth the heart, <hi>Acts 15. 9. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. The Juſt lives by it, as well <hi>religiouſly,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. as <hi>ſafely</hi> and <hi>peaceably,</hi> Mark 5. 34. and is not onely freed by it from the guilt but the filth of ſin: The name of Faith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from holineſs, hath this aſperſion and diſ-reputation, to be ſtiled a vain faith, <hi>a dead faith,</hi> Jam. 2. 20. a faith like the Devils faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. No conviction will be to unbelievers: Can the <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting World, be drawn to own and love ſuch pretenders to intereſt in his perfect righteouſneſs, who live unrighteouſly: They are apt to think the happineſs of this imputation is but a fancy and a fable, that produceth not ſhining and glorious fruits: When they that for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake ſtand righteous in Gods account, <hi>ariſe and ſhine, and the glory of Gods holineſs is ſeen upon them;</hi> even wicked men will enquire after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and be conſtrained to think well of that Maſter, whoſe name is ſo ſanctified and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious in his ſervants.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="7">7.

The <hi>largeſt tale of duties,</hi> and <hi>ſharpeſt ſufferings</hi> of this life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make up a compleat righteouſneſs. When perſonal, <hi>defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient performances,</hi> will wantonly get up into the throne, and juſtle out the abſolute obedience of Chriſt: This ſetting up of a <hi>weak righteouſneſs within,</hi> above Chriſts <hi>perfect one without,</hi> will to the hazard of the guilty ſinners periſhing, fail in ſeven things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There will be no pacification of an angry God: No gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts nor godly lives atone God. Chriſts Sacrifice one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was Propitiatory: We joy in the Atonement, ſaid the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. but by <hi>Chriſts death.</hi> The higheſt meaſures of Believers doings or ſufferings, cannot turn away Gods wrath for the leaſt ſin: It was <hi>Jobs</hi> Faith, when a penitent ſinner <hi>ſeeth his righteouſneſs, he ſeeth his atonement,</hi> Job 33. 23, 24. That is onely by Chriſt, not a Believer: His own Prayers, Tears, Alms, Duties, do not pacifie God, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. It is a common practical error, we will be weeping and doing to turn away Gods avenging diſpleaſure: For though theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are means appointed by God, yet we muſt look through them unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There will be no ſatisfaction of Gods Juſtice: Sin hath done infinite wrong: Juſtice would have an infinite reparation: Now it is impoſſible that finite doings and ſufferings can make infinite ſatisfaction: A reſt then in failing inherent holineſs, at once leaves infinite Juſtice unſatisfied, and ſouls unſaved, Who of the beſt can tell that he hath done and ſuffered enough to make God amends for his ſins, yea for the leaſt ſin?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There will be no proportion to the rigid Laws requiries; It will not abate one Law nor Circumſtance of Duty: The Law <hi>is exceeding broad.</hi> The eminenteſt of Saints that have ſtudied the Law, and their own hearts and lives, could never bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119125:48"/> God an exact obedience parallel to command: Had not Chriſt perfectly fulfilled the Law, the exacteſt Chriſtians could have no grounded hope of Heaven.

The Lord Chriſt his perſonall duty is beleevers perfect righteouſneſs, not their own ſanctification.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There will be no eſcaping the curſe of the Law: Chriſt crucified was made <hi>a curſe for his people.</hi> Galat. 3. 13. that they might not be accurſed. Their ſervices and penalties are no deliverances from Gods curſe, which unremoved will flame in everlaſting burnings. All beleevers have infinite reaſon to ſay, The Lord Jeſus, not their own Graces, <hi>hath delivered them from the wrath to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. There will be no refuge againſt conſcience ſtormes, in a <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 10.</note> truſted-in righteouſneſſe of graces. Bare inherent holyneſſe, failing and polluted, with corrupt mixtures, cannot ſecure a tempted ſoul by the Laws arreſts, the accuſing conſcience, and Satans indictments. This ſubtle and potent pleader will drive aſſaulted Chriſtians from the weak holds of their pettie perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, yea bring them to the brink of deſpair, untill they run to the Croſs of Chriſt, and get within the invincible and royal Fort, Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſſe: This is the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge againſt their ſharpeſt temptations, and conſcience-ſtormes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12, 14. and 10. 2.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There will not be a ſufficient Argument, utterly to ſtrip believers from all glorying in themſelves about a perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: Would our own bare obedience be a current title to glory, beleevers might wantonly applaud themſelves, and dance about their high duties, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> about their Golden Idol, they might commend themſelves, and boaſt in heart, for the glory of their holyneſſe, their Prayers, Tears, Alms, Mortification, as they are too apt to do. But when they know and beleeve the Lord <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> Chriſt is <hi>made Righteouſneſs unto them,</hi> there was not ſo much as a good thought either in them, or from them contributed, to the making of this glorious robe imputed righteouſneſs; now they are denyed all glorying in themſelves. As to their perfect legal obedience, they onely glory in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>He is of God made</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:119125:48"/> 
                     <hi>our righteouſneſſe, that according as it is written, he that gloryeth let him glory in the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There will be no ſure title to eternal life. The perfect and infinite righteouſneſs of the God-man Jeſus Chriſt, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent intitling purchaſe, to the Goſpels infinite reward of the next life. As God is <hi>juſt and a juſtifier of beleevers,</hi> ſo he is <hi>juſt and will be their glorifier,</hi> Rom. 3. 26. 2 Tim. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe things be a warning to all thoſe that would ſecure their hopes, confidences, and joyes of ſalvation, from miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, to ſtudy that righteouſneſſe, which will fully and equally anſwer the demands of infinite juſtice, and as to a juſtified eſtate from the guilt of ſin, to account their imperfect obedience, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, defective, yea as dung, compared with the complere perſonal righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt: But alaſs! this error is too common, yea too much an error in reall Chriſtians, very ignorant of the myſtery of an imputed Righteouſneſſe, to lay either the whole, or the greateſt weight on a weak foundation. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſpake much of virtue, but their external ſhining vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were <hi>headleſs virtues,</hi> becauſe they were without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip of the true God; ſo were it poſſible that an unjuſtified perſon ſhould eminently ſhine in all the graces of the Spirit, and be voted the none-ſuch of the Age in contempt of the world, mortification, and new obedience; theſe graces would be <hi>headleſs graces:</hi> Chriſt would profit him nothing in his choiceſt doings and ſufferings, while his active and paſſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is nor a ſinners infinite, compleat, and everlaſting righteouſneſſe.</p>

Inſtead of the bleſſed hope, or hope of bleſſedneſſe, the regular and warrantable expectation of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, there is a common hope and a curſed hope of Satans ſuggeſtion, and corruptions entertainment, though men conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their ſinnes they ſhall have heaven at length. This hope never purifyed the heart and life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. but will prove to them that truſt in it, like the thin and weak <hi>webb to the ſpider,</hi> be ſwept away with the beſom of deſtruction: <hi>An evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>

                     <hi>is the moſt dangerous companion of Hope.</hi> Becauſe many hope to be ſaved in the way of ruin, their diſeaſes become incurable, like fooliſh patients that conclude health from that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth their diſeaſe, and haſtneth their death. Carnal hopes might have been cured by conditionall deſpair, that ever ſoules ſhould be ſaved, while falſe hopes are reſted in. An hope of life in the paths of death, is deſtruction to the ſoul. A deſpair of ever getting good by ſuch an hope, might make men looke out for better hopes, and more ſaving ſecurities. There are doubtleſſe many that will in the other world curſe their irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, unſcripturall, and groundleſſe hopes of Heaven. A Prince hopes to wear his Fathers Crown, How doth he abuſe his hopes by living like a ſcullion, and conſorting with beggars: Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable imployments are below Royal ſtate. Many hope to wear the <hi>white robes of glory,</hi> Rev. 3. 4, 5. and yet embrace dunghill luſts and courſes, live diſhonourably and abuſively under their high expectations. Theſe reſemble the Lapwing (accounted an Emblem of infelicity) which feeds on dung, though it weares a Coronet on its head. In the common abuſed hope of glory, Hope is put out of office; the ſprings of Hope are not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the work of hope is not done; the properties of Hope are not to be found.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hope is put out of office.</p>
                  <p>It hath the office of a ſetling Anchor in heaven, in tempeſtuous and troubleſome times. But the vulgar hope, though it pretend heaven for its hold, caſts Anchor only among the creatures of which is worſe, among the Devils, ſtaying and ſtrengthning it ſelf in their counſels and luſts.</p>
                  <p>It hath the office of a ſaving <hi>refuge,</hi> againſt Afflictions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, Temptations, Corruptions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. The carnal hope
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119125:49"/> of glory hath no City of Refuge but below, <hi>viz.</hi> Wits, Riches, Friends, Honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath the office of purging water, which makes inſide and <note place="margin">Job 31. 24. 1 John 3. 3.</note> outſide clean: The falſe hope of heaven, wallows Swine-like in the filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, layes in the mire of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but riſeth not out.</p>
                  <p>It hath the office of a diligent ſervant; It looks for an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward, and <hi>it ſerves God day and night,</hi> Act. 26. 6, 7. But the bare fancy of the hope of glory, is content to ſerve the world, fleſh, and devill. It looks for an heavenly harveſt, and yet follows Satans Plow, and <hi>ſoweth to the fleſh.</hi> Gal. 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>It hath the office of a comforting cordial: <hi>Good hope through Grace is the hearts comforter:</hi> But the feigned hope of glory gives no more real comfort than the dream of a cordial doth a ſleeping or dying man. Carnal hopes never drinks out of the cup of heavenly conſolations; no draughts really pleaſe them but of earthly ſolaces. Thus doe unregenerate men, what ever they think, put the hope of glory out of office; ſo in the common abuſed hope of glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſprings of hope are not regarded.</p>
                  <p>The Free grace of God is a Spring of Hope. <hi>Good hope through Grace,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 16. But looſe ſpirits are as much ſtrangers to the glory, puritie, and power of Free grace, as true Hope. They have not <hi>good hope</hi> through grace, but <hi>ill hope,</hi> through preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The holy Ghoſt is a ſpring of hope, that ye may abound <hi>in hope by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. But un-Goſpel wantons have their hopes from the evil ſpirits ſuggeſtion, not the good ſpirits inſpiration.</p>
                  <p>The perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a ſpring of hope: <hi>The hope of righteouſneſs,</hi> Gal. 5. 5. But the dreamers of Heavenly hopes, take the riſe of their high hopes from their opinionative righteouſneſs, their good meanings, good works, as they think, &amp; external either moralities outward, or religious exerciſes, or both.</p>
                  <p>Juſtifying Faith is a Spring of hope. <hi>Rom. 5. 1, 2. The hope of glory grows out of it.</hi> But the vaine barren hope of Glory iſſues from ſelf-ſufficiencie. As it comes not from a juſtified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſo neither doth it ſhew any evidence of ſanctifying Grace.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſe is a Spring of Hope. <hi>The Hope of the Promiſe,</hi> Act. 26. 6. but lying hope of glory never ſprang from any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-promiſe.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119125:50"/> 
                     <hi>For the promiſes have a cleanſing virtue.</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. The hope of the wicked hath none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Love of God ſhed abroad in the heart, is a ſpring of Hope:</hi> It makes not aſhamed from the ſweet ſenſe of divine love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. But a ſenſual, brutiſh hope of glory never felt the ſweet pleaſures of Gods love. They that are acquainted with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe delights of it, are not wont to run a whoring after crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſportings, much leſſe after ſinfull joyes. The glorious feaſtings of the delicious, eternal, diſtinguiſhing Love of God in renewed ſoules, have a mortifying virtue of pleaſing vanities below.</p>
                  <p>Gracious Experience is a Spring of Hope. <hi>Experience worketh Hope.</hi> Rom. 5. 4. The Experience of Regenerating Grace, of thoſe ſweet whiſpers, Thy perſon is accepted, <hi>Fear not, I am thy God,</hi> Chriſt is made to thee <hi>Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Redemption,</hi> of the mighty awe of Gods preſence in the ſoul, of hating vain thoughts, of cleanſing from ſecret ſins, of ſealing of promiſes, of victory over corruption, and much more, work renewed hopes of glory, that God will both perfect and reward his own work. The filthy ſtreames of a diſſolute hope of heaven, that are ſtrangers to theſe pure ſprings, betray their impure originalls. The unclean ſpirit, the filthy heart, the worlds pollutions, are the common abuſed Hope of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Work of Hope is not done.</p>
                  <p>The work of Hope is to work patient and diligent continuance in well-doing: <hi>We deſire you to ſhew diligence to the full of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope unto the end,</hi> Heb. 6. 11. But Hypocrites moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hopes are both <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>tranſient,</hi> they neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſtrength, nor will they hold out; they have ſhort breath, lame legs, and withered hands; and are a meer vapour, a fancie, and worke no diligence, nor perſeverance in the waies of Godlyneſs.</p>
                  <p>True Hope will work the ſoul out of the vanities, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies, inordinate rejoycings of earthly Hope. <hi>Job</hi> had the hope of glory before his eyes; hence he was aſſured, that hee ſhould ſee his Redeemer; this ſwallowed up earthly hopes; <hi>If I have made gold my hope, or have ſaid to the fine gold thou art my confidence. If I rejoyced becauſe my wealth was great, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:119125:50"/> Job 31. 24, 25. But the diſſembled Hopes of Glory never dead the heart to the vaine truſts and joyes of earthly Hopes, when theſe are gone, thoſe have no eſtate in the other world.</p>
                  <p>It is the work of Hope to work up the ſoul to the infinite Riches, Pleaſures, and Honours that are above: <hi>The Hope that is laid up for you in heaven,</hi> Col. 1. 5. But the adulterate hopes of heaven ſhew their falſeneſſe. Reall worldlings hopes under Goſpel pretenſions, are faſtned onely to periſhing things, and muſt periſh like themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is the work of Hope to ſuccour the hearts of fainting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, to ſtrengthen the feeble knees, as a good daughter helps a ſickly mother: When Faith, the Mother Grace, is ready to faint, Hope the daughter lends it a ſupporting hand, and ſayes, hold out Faith. There is an expected end of corruptions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: Look Faith, O look within the heavenly vayl, even Holy of Holyes. Conflicts are ſharp, O Faith ſee thy Crowns: Wants are many, O Faith ſee thy Supplies. The race of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is tireſome, O Faith ſee thy Prize: Now there is ſowing in tears, O Faith ſee thy joyes: The ſweet countenance of God is clouded, O Faith ſee his eternal ſmiles: Beleevers are toſſed with the waves of doubtings, deſpondencies, ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, O Faith ſee thine unſhaken aſſurance, and everlaſting reſt. But the eaſie, falſe-hearted hopes, of notional Chriſtians, can never ſuccour their fainting Faiths. At beſt their Faith was but fancy, their confidence preſumptuous; and when their falſe faiths expire, their groundleſs hopes are gone too. Ah miſerable ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivers, that wrong the Faith, and Hope of Glory, In the common abuſed hopes of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Properties of Hope are not to be found.</p>
                  <p>The Hope of Glory is a regenerated Hope. <hi>Begotten to a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. It is one of the new births graces: The Hope of Unregeneracie then is a ſpurious hope. New hopes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grow out of the old ſoyle. The Hope of Glory is an high born grace, its pedigree is abuſed, when a vile, ſenſual, wicked life, a baſtard iſſue is laid at its doors.</p>
                  <p>The Hope of Glory is an Active Hope. High hopes oyl the wheels of motion. Hopes of great Matches, Pardons, Liberty, ſweeteſt earthly Pleaſures, Riches, Crowns, ſhake off ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119125:51"/> A reall Chriſtian hath the higheſt hopes, and this makes him goe, yea run the wayes of Gods Commandements. Too many abuſe the hopes of glory: They are negligent, lazy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, yea oppoſers in the methods and unpleaſing ſervices of Goſpel Hope. What doe moſt that hope for Heaven doe to get it? Where are their wreſtlings at the Throne of Grace? Where their ſelf-denyals? Where their Fightings in Spiritual Armes againſt their corruptions?

                  <p>The Hope of Glory is a Rejoycing Hope: <hi>We rejoice in the Hope of Glory,</hi> Rom. 5. 2. When the Perſpective of Faith hath fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the farre diſtant bleſſed objects of Eternity, hath realized, and ſubſtantialized them to the ſoul, ſo that Faith ſaith to Hope, I ſee the glory of Heaven, I ſee the infinite rewards of ſound Chriſtians, I ſee the infinite pleaſures, and ſatisfactions, and raviſhing joys of thoſe bleſſed Citizens above: Then ſaies Hope, I look for them, I expect them with unſpeakable joy, I wait for their Revelations and Fruitions. A real Chriſtian will not part with the joyes of his Hopes for a thouſand worlds. He is incomparably richer in hopes than worldlings are in hand; but a deluſive hope of glory continually joyned with joyous, ſolitary, worldly hopes, is a ſtranger to the joyes of heavenly hopes. The Hypocrite hath the fancy, but never the reallitie of theſe hopes. The joyes of theſe do not in him out-joy the joyes of earthly hopes, they doe not lighten and ſweeten the loſſe of worldly expectations: Experience will prove it of unſound pretenders to their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing hopes of Glory. That if their hopes and the joy of their hopes below are gone, they have no rejoycing hopes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p>The hope of Glory is a Luſt denying hope. <hi>The grace of God teacheth us the deniall of worldly luſts, looking for that bleſſed hope.</hi>

When we play the wantons with our luſts, we think God and our ſelves alike: <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf,</hi> Pſal. 50. 21.

                  <p>The Hope of Glory is a well living Hope. <hi>The ſaving grace of God teacheth us to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; looking for the bleſſed hope, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 2. 12, 13. <hi>I have hope towards God, that there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and the unjuſt, and herein doe I exerciſe my ſelf, to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards men.</hi> Act. 24. 15, 16. He that hopes for the full ſumme, is glad of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring earneſt; hee that would have the full harveſt, is pleaſed with the firſt fruits. The hope of glory that rejoyceth to thinke of the eternal ſumme and harveſt of holyneſs, is carefull to get, and joyfull to obtain the earneſt and firſt fruits of the Spirit of grace. But the common, abſurd, fooliſh hope of glory, expects an heavenly, eternal ſumme, when it hath no earneſt here; looks for an eternal harveſt, when the firſt fruits are neglected and deſpiſed; it pleaſingly dreams to live happily with God in glory, when it never lived holily with God in grace.</p>
                  <p>The hope of Glory is an Affliction-enduring, and ſanctifying Hope.

What injury is it to Grace, to contemplate, but never practice Mortification; to profeſs the Chriſtian warfare, but never to fight; or in undue arms, or without skill to put on Gods Armor, or to ſleep in them, or to lay them by, or to run to the enemy, and ſo to do no execution on carnal Luſts and Affections? What is this, but to diſparage, and endeavor, what in us lies, to degrade Divine Power, from the glory of its victorious ability, as if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted corruption from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> could ſtill be too hard for the Grace of the ſecond? How doth a powerleſs profeſſion over ſin, proclaim it ſelf a ſtranger to the mighty Arm of the Prince of Grace, never feeling the power of theſe truths: <hi>Chriſt brings forth judgement unto victory,</hi> Matth. 12. 20. <hi>Greater is he that is in victorious Believers, than he that is in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 4.

Doth not all the Grace of vain, idle opinionative Chriſtians, that ſeems to be expreſſed in Prayer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or of ſet forms; in appearing to be taken, with gracious examples, Sermons, Chapters, good Books, and Conference, evacuate into lazy Speculation, and powerleſs profeſſion?

                  <p>3. When Chriſt is deſired for his comforts, not for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Gods grace is turned into wantonneſs. Thus many take Chriſt to ſerve their turnes of him, not to ſerve him, for a <hi>ſhelter</hi> to comfort them in ſtorms, not a <hi>Maſter</hi> to doe his will. When under the terrors and ſorrows of death and hell they would have <hi>comfortable words</hi> from Chriſt, even then when they have rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts againſt him. I have heard from an eye, and ear-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a ſad report of a tipling, adulterous, prophane man, when he had the terrours of an angry God on his wounded ſoul, and not onely fear of Hell, but confeſſed feeling of the paines and flames of hell in his ſpirit, was in his fleſh (like another trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Balſhazar</hi> at the hand writing againſt him) a real afflicted Quaker, ſent for the Miniſter, cried out of his groſſe ſinnes, yea his barren and forſaken uſe of reading and prayer, but the ſlaviſh ſorrows were ſoon waſted, and the terrified ſinner ſoon grew vain, frothy, ſenſuall, and voluptuous. Such as like onely the <hi>pacifying,</hi> but not the <hi>purifying</hi> part of Religion, have whoriſh hearts, <hi>wandring</hi> from God to other Loves, even then when they are afraid of him. Wanton, unclean wives, would have their husbands good lookes, words, and gifts, though diſobedient to them, and defilers of the Marriage bed. Thus too many adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearts, when the lips only matched with Jeſus Chriſt, would have the <hi>comforts</hi> of Reconciliation, Remiſſion, Adoption, the peace and joyes of the Holy Ghoſt, even then when they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn</hi> his holy ſtrict Goſpel-government. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> will be a condemning inſtance againſt theſe ſelfiſh wantons. <hi>As he obtained Pardoning mercy.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13. So he was <hi>the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 1. 1. yea <hi>laboured in Chriſts vineyard more than any of the Apoſtles,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. Should God put ſound

Holy reaſon would thus conſider: Though that great Idol carnal ſelf were beaten down, ſweet luſts and pleaſures were mortified, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful guilt, and diſhonors to God, were lookt over with broken hearts and weeping eyes, the vanities and pomps of the world were renounced; the frequent requiries of the Scripture, and neceſſities of the poor, call for, and command coſtly alms: Though Faſtings and Watchings, continual ſpiritual Arms and Combates, Prayers and Tears, Deſertions and Afflictions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of unlawful, yea often times of lawful things, render pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical chriſtian Religion, a formidable, unchooſable and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing: Though the entrance and progreſs of godlineſs be ſtrict, ſevere, painful, and <hi>rigid to the fleſh,</hi> and bears an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing dominion over the ſenſitive appetite; yet on this ſoure crab-ſtock is engraffed, by the hand of Gods Spirit, ſweet fruit: After this dirty Lane, the reproaches and ſufferings of this life, there will be getting unto the Heavenly Fathers Houſe: I ſay, ſpiritual reaſon will aſſure, that the ſharpeſt ſtorms of Religion, will do the kindneſs as to drive Heavenly Paſſengers, to the Port of their everlaſting Reſt; and though the ſpiritual Battles may be long and ſharp, yet they will end in eternal Peace, Victory and Triumph.

Hence the Sirens of the

This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">11 The error of ſufficient attainments in Religion cauſeth abaſe of Grace.</note> is practically debauching. Thoſe that ſeemed to make haſt heaven-wards, and think they have travelled almoſt enough in the way everlaſting, that have dreamed either of their poſſible or actuall perfection in this life, need no better diſcovery of their nakedneſs than themſelves, they are their own ſufficient confutation. How far are the generation of Popiſh and Quaking Perfectiſts, from the prize they ſeem to run after? further off, were their eyes opened, than thoſe they un-ſaint from Goſpel-attainments. This ſottiſh, ſupercilious opinion of <hi>enoughs</hi> in the knowledge and practice of Religion hath begotten <hi>monſtrous libertines</hi> in the preſent age. Such as have been filled, with windy ſwelling conceits, not the real fruits of the Spirit; like ſome of the high-flown <hi>puffed up Corinthians, reigned as Kings,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 8. bleſſed themſelves in their high attainments, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge, Faith, Love, Mortification, Communion with God, Joyes of the Spirit; and noy, as if rich enough, they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to doe but to contemplate their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

As ſome men that have gotten vaſt eſtates, look over their rich Lordſhips with much contentment, are knighted, trade no more, have goods layd up for many years, ſo many rich <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> that think they abound in ſpiritual goods, and want nothing, and have nothing, no more than an empty ſounding barrel, and are ſainted in Satans
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119125:71"/> Kalender; theſe trade no more in heavenly negotiation, as if they could too much increaſe their Lords Talent, and give fearfull ſymptomes, that for all the puffs of their ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, they are but bankrupts. That generation is well known, who have already decried and voted down Gods ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, as needleſſe, who load them with no better honours than the ſtile of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the people, the Locuſts of the bottomleſs pit, the fewel for the fierie furnace of Hell, and ſo bind up all Preachers in the ſame bundle of death; as well the moſt induſtrious, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and conſcientious, as the moſt lazy, looſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable. Hath not this wanton, daring Age brought forth ſuch proud, pittifull, poor (it is to be feared, but <hi>nominal)</hi> chriſtians, that have had the boldneſs to call mourning for ſin, a low attainment; dayly prayer, a poor ſapleſs buſineſſe; all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſolemn, as well as publick, vanities, carnall things, too low for their ſpiritual, ſeraphical ſpirits, as if they were not in the body, nor had no body of ſin, as if they were ſo Angelical in their high Revelations, and maintained ſo conſtant, blazing divine fire of love to God, as that it needed no further fewell, nor bellows of Ordinances, nor the Spirits hands to uſe them, for holy and heavenly heart inflammations. Now behold with fear and trembling the ſpirituall Judgement of ſpiritual Pride, ſpiritual Blindneſs, ſpiritual Wickedneſs, ſpiritual, yea viſible groſs Apoſtaſie. 'Tis juſt with God, that they which will not keep in the ſafe plain, the ſecure beaten valley, but they will be mounting up to the narrow tops of hills perilous pinacles, they ſhould fall, and that deadly. Some men and women have not contented themſelves (yea to their ſhame it muſt be ſpoken, ſome Miniſters) with the ſafe plain, the Ordinances of Grace, the Doctrines of Faith, Repentance, Mortification, and New obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, nor keep in the ſecure valley of walking humbly with God, but mounting up in their lofty minds, to the tops of Hils, Doctrines too high for them, injudicious unſcriptural Altitudes; the perillous Pinacles of conceited Perfection, a ſtupid, and ſenſleſs aſſertion of a kind of <hi>Adam</hi>-like Innocence before the Fall; That they that are born of God ſin not at all: I ſay ſome are the ſpiritual black marks of Gods vengeance, from theſe perillous heights: The viſible and fearfull falls of haughty adventurous

                  <p>1. The Preſumption of a Prepoſterous Confidence in Gods mercy, this hath begotten carnall ſecurity, and ſtrengthened the hands of wickedneſſe. Dreames of mercy have been the bane of duty, Patrons of looſeneſſe, and ſoft pillowes for delicate wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons to ſleep on. God is good, God is mercifull, and therefore the old man dares be ſinfull; as if God were not a prudent and pure diſpenſer, but careleſſe prodigall of his rich mercies: he is beleeved to waſt them on the Devills ſervice, and to rain down their Heavenly ſhowers, upon a barren wilderneſſe, an unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Profeſſion. But where have we a word in ſacred Writ, that the ſervant of ſin muſt firſt be confident of Gods mercy? Did <note place="margin">

Tis true, mercy is to be found to the praiſe of the glory, not the infamy of mercy, as a cordiall to the fainting, a plaiſter to the wounded ſinner, a ſpur to ſervice, not a Feaſt to riot on, when looſe Libertines take not mercy (the childrens bread) by Gods allowance, but like Dogs, endeavour to get it from his Table, and are cudgelled off from it: did they ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the way of obtaining mercy, the Leſſons mercy teacheth, the evidence of mercies poſſeſſion, the Diſtinction mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy maketh, the reputation mercy muſt have in the world, they would ſoon be convinced, they are at as infinite a diſtance from mercy as they are from innocency and duty.</p>

That mercy receivers are humble, ſelfe-aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, condemning Soliciters, wonder they are not in Hell paſt mercy, and the asking of it, like the Servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> that came with ropes about their necks, at once confeſſing their deſerts, &amp; wooing the favours of a mercifull King. 5.

                  <p>1. They learn not the Leſſons mercy teacheth, in ſpeciall two, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, and Subjection. 1. Reſignation, the giving upthe whole perſon in a reall gratitude to Gods ſervice, who inſtead of a wonder of mercy, might have made the provoking ſinner a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vengeance. <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, give up your bodies, &amp;c.</hi> Pom. 12. 1. 2. Subjection, <hi>As many as walke according to this rule mercy be on them,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. Every mercy ſaith, be dutifull; but choice, ſaving mercy calls for regular walking. Thoſe licencious daring ones that challenge mercy, ſay with thoſe in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> We are Lords, we will not come to thee, are their own Maſters, live as they liſt, know no Law but their Luſts, were never Schollars well trained up in the School of mercy.</p>
                  <p>3. They have no evidence of mercies poſſeſſion, the fear of God is this great evidence, The mercy of God is from everlaſting to everlaſting on them that fear him. <hi>pſal.</hi> 103. 17. Gods feare
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119125:81"/> ſtands between two happy Eternities of mercy, as the faire mark of both; the decree of mercy from Eternity, the enjoyment of mercy to Eternity is the ſure Felicity of all that fear God. O falſhood, folly, madneſſe! Too many that neither feare God nor ſin, conclude a part in the mercy of the Booke of life, and looke for the endleſſe mercy, of the other world, and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed licenſe of mercy, live wickedly.</p>
                  <p>4. They ſtudy not the diſtinction, mercy maketh, ſurely all deſigned for mercy, are veſſells of mercy, all that are, and ſhall be without it, are veſſells of wrath: an unchanged heart, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed life under mercy maketh no difference between the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of mercy and wrath. If veſſells of mercy may be Libertines, they &amp; veſſells of wrath both wil be carnall walkers, mercy &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wrath &amp; ſin, wil be an everlaſting diſtinction between the heirs of Heaven, and the purchaſers of Hell. Veſſells of wrath will be Libertines if veſſells of mercy are ſo too, the one is as good as the other.</p>
                  <p>5. They bring not Gods mercy in Reputation in the world, what honour hath God in pretenders to mercy, that abuſe his Grace? They who are deſigned to mercy, are veſſells of honour. <hi>2 Tim. 2. 21.</hi> Not only to import they are called to honourable priviledges, but honourable ſervices: As God honours them in holding out his golden Scepter of mercy to them, ſo they are to honour God in being glorious within, and wearing without the golden apparrel of an heavenly ſhining converſation, <hi>pſ. 45. 13. paul</hi> obtained ſaving mercy, he was an high &amp; eminent veſſell of Honour, and he honourably uſed his mercy to the praiſe of its Author, <hi>I obtained mercy, and the Grace of God was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in me through Faith and Love. 1 Tim. 1. 13. 14.</hi> The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mercy God beſtowed on him, was honourably and richly adorned by ſanctifying grace. Licentious Profeſſors do not honour but caſt dirt upon the Robe of mercy; were it not for preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mercy, falſe Chriſtians would not ſo play the wantons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Goſpell Profeſſion. Did they think and ſpeak the truth in our unregenerate hypocriticall and profane Eſtates, that there is no mercy for us, we are children of Wrath, if we live and dye ſo, we periſh, this would damp the pleaſing merry fits of ſin, if this do not turn them Heavenwards, it will force upon them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gripes and conſcience pangs in the way to Hell. The ſame

The old man is a looſe Libertine, where ever he is, the new creature is not perfect.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119125:89"/> abounded in the offenſive notices of pious perſons miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for which they are unſainted by malicious, critical obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who better obſerve a mote in the eyes of Gods ſervants, than a beam in their own; yea look upon a groſs ſinne in ſtrict walkers, contrary to the vent and ſtream of their converſation, as the unpardonable ſin, or next unto it, who bind up them and their hated fellows in the ſame black bundle of death, as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. What we experience, that acute ſtudents of true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſcandals, who hate their power of godlyneſs, and without charity rejoyce in their iniquity, feaſt themſelves with their ſins, not their graces, had rather feed on the Devils dung, than Angels food, at every turn of wry words and actions thus flout and ſcoff; Theſe are your Puritans; thus doe your Puritans; thus doe your Puritans ſay and doe, and beleeve: O that the nick-named Puritans would be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and loath themſelves, and repent of their polluted hearts, lips and wayes then their impure deriders, doe take a diſallowed liberty to ſinne and blaſpheme the waies of God.

Men and Women dare to be prophane exceſſively, voluptuous, irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, yea turn Papiſts, becauſe ſome Profeſſors have ſpotted their garments. The Devils ſwine with delight will wallow in their mire, becauſe Chriſts ſheep, contrary to their cleanly nature, are faln into the dirt: Becauſe unwary walkers have with great ſmart broke their bones, deſperate mad ones will breake their necks. Tis not more irrational than unſafe, becauſe one man againſt his ſerious purpoſe is ſelf-wounded, therefore another will kill himſelfe. Seeing it is thus by experience, which is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, if poſſible, with tears of blood, that viſible looſeneſſe in Gods ſervants, is a ſpeeding temptation to unconſcionable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſme in wicked perſons.

Be no longer Satans Merchants to put off his wares. The leaſt part of his drudgery ill becomes Gods ſervants.

                  <p>1.

If they trade poorly in heavenly commodities that have a ſtock of grace, muſt not I be a bankrupt in goodneſſe that have not a dramme? If they ſin thus that have a principle of life, what danger am I in, a dead ſinner of eternal death? To follow a good mans ſin, is at once ſin and puniſhment; a piece of ſad vengeance; God in wrath againſt me, may ſuffer them to fall and break their ſhins, that I may fall and loſe my life. <note place="margin">Non voluit ea ſcribi ſpiritus ſanctus, ad sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale exemplum, ſed in cenſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionem, non ad confirmandam licentiam, pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati in poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſed ad ſpem &amp; fidem excitandam. <hi>Luth. in Gen.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have ſeen the aggravated evil of this too common and diſhonourable Sin, the Abuſe of Grace. We can be in nothing more croſſe to the choice deſign of God, than in wronging his grace. Not to give God the praiſe of the glory of his goodneſs in nature, is deep ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but to deny him the praiſe of the glory of his grace is deeper indignity. The wrath of a King will be more enraged when he is abuſed in his Throne, than in his Common Highway. The Goſpel acquaints us with Gods Throne of grace: God ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his grace is an abuſed King in his Throne. This without repentance will turn the Throne of grace into a Throne of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Juſtice. They that abuſe the blood of the Lamb, ſhall feel the wrath of the Lamb. No damnation like that which is heightned by the abuſe of Salvation. For the Goſpel to be a ſavour of death unto death, puts a ſharper and fiercer ſting into eternal death, than when it puniſheth onely unnatural ſinnes. God ſets black marks of his diſpleaſure upon the Abuſe of Goſpel grace. He is wont to plague it with theſe puniſhments; in ſpecial ſix ſad ones, wherein he expreſſeth dreadfull vengeance.</p>

The like vengeance he hath exerciſed on the injuries done to his Goſpel grace. The Lord proclamed himſelf to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in an external Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. <hi>I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of AEgypt:</hi> typifying the Grace of Redemption from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran and the world, ſweetly inviting them to deſire and accept his grace, with enlarged hearts, <hi>open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81. 10. But this ſweet tender of grace in poſtive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, was wantonly rejected: <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me;</hi> and thus the Lord plagued them with their own choice and waies; <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts, and they walked in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> ver. 12. The ſadneſſe of this Judgement in giving ſinners up to their carnal Luds, for the perverting of Gods grace, appears in four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a ſad judgement for a ſinfull, weak, erring creature to be deprived of a ſafe, unerring guide, the Grace of God. When <note place="margin">

The ſpiritual departure of Gods grace is a great puniſhment of obſtimte contumacie. It is juſt that grace ſhould forſake thoſe that forſake it, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 24. 24. that they ſhould have none of its ſafetie, that wil have none of its ſoveraignty; that they ſhould periſh without it, that would not be ruled by it. It is <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> reſemblance, when a King ſeeth <note place="margin">

The way of man to obtain everlaſting happineſs is not in himſelf: He is ſafe in Gods way, but periſheth in his own.</p>

It would mortifie deareſt luſts which they nouriſh, pull down the pride they live in, break their hard hearts, which are now ſtoney, forgive the wrongs they cannot forget, turn the ſpirit of the world out of their hearts, cauſe them to deny ſelf they ſeek, new mold the inward and the outward man. Common petitioners are falſe-hearted to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intereſt of their own ſoules, and the honour of God in his grace: The grace they pray for amiſs they miſs; for as in the Poetick Fiction, <hi>Ixion</hi> had but a cloud for <hi>Juno;</hi> ſo theſe in their Devout Fiction have what they ſought for, but a ſhadow for grace.

Am I ſtrong? Doe I live? Have I ſo good a Maſter? Is it that I ſhould be a looſe, wanton ſervant, and do him no work? What bluſhing will ſit on the face, trembling on the limbs, horror on the hearts of pretenders to Gods grace, in the accounting day, when large Creature-allowances, ſhall in all their ſad inventories, be proved to be wreſted from the imployments of Gods reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. End of Gods Creature-mercies, is the exaltation and commendation of his loving kindneſs. <hi>Davids</hi> gracious ſpirit, verſed in the high praiſes of God, did ordinarily take the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods goodneſs and kindneſs from Creature-mercies, and ſpent Pſalms in Doxologies, ſeeing the glory of God in the glaſs of the Creatures ſhining before his ſpirit, and in and in high ſtrains of praiſe, exalted the great and glorious name of God, made the Creatures Trumpets to ſound his praiſe, and an occaſion of high thoughts of God. Indeed he that is thankful to God for his unſpeakable gift of Jeſus Chriſt, cannot, but having the beſt Goſpel-tenure of common mercies, holding them in <hi>capite,</hi> praiſe God for every periſhing mercy, as a token of ſpecial e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love, and an earneſt penny of eternal mercies. His bread to him is Covenant-bread, his Apparel Covenant-apparel, his Money Covenant-money, yea, his Afflictions Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afflictions; whether he have much or little, its all to him the diſpenſation of choice kindneſs, and the allotted ſufficiency of infinite Wiſdom and Love, to bear his charges in the narrow road to life, until he come to his Fathers Houſe and eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beritance: But now to rob God of this glorious end, the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his love, or to reſent no love but of Creature-mercies, and to proſtitute that to ſelf-love and carnal ſenſualities; How below is this to the honor of man, the glory of God, and the power of Grace?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. End of Gods Creature-mercies, in ſpiritualizing the Creatures: Turning Earth into Heaven, making viſible created Excellencies, Ladders to climb up to the inviſible God: The pious practice of our Lord Jeſus, in his holy, heavenly travels, to lead the underſtandings of men, by the light and hand of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119125:130"/> Creatures, to the apprehenſions of heavenly and immaterial things, by a Well of water ſtill ſpringing up, ſignifying the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spring of the Spirit of grace in regenerate ſouls; what by fleſhly relations, leading us to believe the high account he hath of ſpiritual kindred; by ſeed loſt in evil ground, fruitful in good, inſtructing us in the word, loſt to moſt hearers, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a few good and honeſt hearts; by all his Parables, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly picturing out the Orient Beauties and Glories of his Kingdom of grace and glory, and the ugly face of ſin. Holy <hi>Bradford</hi> was happy this way, who made Creature-mercies his advantage ground to ſee into Goſpel-glories: When putting on Apparel, his thoughts were, O Chriſt cloath me with thine own ſelf, that I catch not the cold of this World! When the cloathes were put off, he thought of death, he ſhould be uncloathed of Fleſh, and of the Reſurrection to put it on again, as his cloathes were put on in the morning: When the day-light appeared, he minded Chriſt the light, that knows no Night nor Evening, but is always as bright Mid-day: His Journying taught him to think this life a Pilgrimage, the way is dangerous, that there is need of Chriſt the Guide in the high way to glory. How injurious are we to Gods end of his Creatures, unto our own rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and to the ingenuities that grace would put upon us, if we gain not affective and active Meditations, by what daily comes into the doors of our ſenſes? If ſo great be the ſweetneſs and glory of Gods out-houſe, the viſible World, what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendencies of delight and honor are the happy reſerves, in the inviſible ſtate and place of heavenly glory in the next life? It is an ungracious frame of ſpirit that is confined to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: They are ſtrangers and enemies to their own happineſs, that could take up with a viſible Eternity of poor ſublunary things, and cannot abide the thoughts of death, the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their earthly Gods.</p>
